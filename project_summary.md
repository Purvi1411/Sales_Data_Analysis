Project Title: Full-Stack Sales Optimization Engine: From Raw Data to Live BI.

Summary: This project successfully converted a raw sales data analysis into a dynamic, deployable Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard using Python and Streamlit. The core achievement was refactoring complex analytical logic into modular scripts (src/analysis.py) and seamlessly integrating them into a user-facing web application. This demonstrates end-to-end proficiency in data processing, visualization, and application deployment, resulting in a live tool for revenue acceleration and performance tracking.
